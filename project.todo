Refactoring:
    comment code
    refactor logic as neccessary
    write documentation

ISSUES:
FIXED empty category is literally a card, -> fix: display some texts under the card
FIXED swipe down to clear card not really needed when opening up the app the second time.
dynamically center and scale texts in the title. consider using an angular directive

fix local storage
fix empty category problem
